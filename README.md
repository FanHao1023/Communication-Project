# Communication Projects
These are my projects during college.
- **Group Members**: Fan-Hao Lin, Han-Lin Hung
- **Advisor**: Chao-Kai Wen

## Geo2SigMap
A deep learning-based signal strength prediction method.
This U-Net model predicts a full signal strength map based on an antenna UMA model, building map, and sparse signal strength data.
- **Reference**: Li et al. (2023), “Geo2SigMap: High-fidelity RF signal mapping using geographic databases,” [Geo2SigMap](https://github.com/functions-lab/geo2sigmap), 2023.

## Geo2ComMap
A deep learning-based throughput prediction method.
This project functions similarly to Geo2SigMap, predicting a full throughput map based on an antenna UMA model, building map, and sparse throughput data.
- **Throughput calculation**: Matlab code developed by NSYSU Communication Technology Lab (De-Ming Chian, Chao-Kai Wen, Feng-Ji Chen, and Tzu-Hao Huang).
